# ChatRoom
A Socket-io based community chat application that
helps people talk in real time over internet(i.e. chat).
To send private chat use @username in begining of message
(IMP: Persons with same username can exist, it was intentionally done,
      and yes private message will be recieved by both of them)
This is **alpha** version and gui will be added in upcomming versions.    
Feel free to contribute the UI and Security (Read my code, security is seriously flawed here :p ).
